Our project goal will be to create an electronic billing system for a local hospital. With this,
we can incorporate all of the necessary components in a way that is easy to understand and delegate
between our teammates. the program will ultimately be able to calculate all necessary charges and fees associated
with a person's stay at the hospital and clearly break down the bill for them. /** Project leader is Omar, working with Victoria and Mohammed
